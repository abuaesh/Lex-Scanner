# Lex-Scanner
A lexical analyzer for given lex specifications/language using Lex generator.

## Installation
**Note:** Make sure you are working in a Linux environment.
You need to install Lex and Yacc. Follow the instruction in [this link](https://jaisantonyk.wordpress.com/2008/03/16/lex-and-yaccbison-in-windows/) for detailed steps to do that.

## Usage

1- Once lex is up and running on your machine, write a lex file with the language specification given [here](). The result is a lex file with the extension _.l_.

2. Compile your lex file in the lex compiler using the command: `flex scanner.l` The result of this command is a C file generated by Lex named _lex.yy.c_ and saved in your root directory.

3. Compile _lex.yy.c_ using a C compiler and save the generated executable as a file, by writing: 
`g++ lex.yy.c –lfl –o output`
By that, the file _output.exe_ is created in the root directory.

4. After that, run the generated executable by typing in the command below and specifying the input file to be tokenized:
`.\output.exe in.txt` we can get the final results as a series of tokens and a list of syntax errors. <- There is a bug in here: FIX IT IF YOU CAN

## Known Issues

The expected results as mentioned before are the tokens and lexemes that should appear in the input file _in.txt_, 
in addition to a list of any violations to the syntax rules specified by the lex file we wrote.
The current code generates warnings of unrecognized rules when the file is compiled using lex, and, errors of undefined variables when _lex.yy.c_ is compiled by the C compiler.
